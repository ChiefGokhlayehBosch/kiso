 * more details.
 *
 * The purpose of this API is to map the Quectel specific AT text-commands
 * into strongly typed C-code. The API tries to closely mimic the AT text
 * interface -- with all its quirks and oddities. Some parts of this API may
 * therefore seem odd to normal C developers. Keep in mind that this API was
 * written for someone who has read the Quectel AT command reference manual,
 * played with some dev-kit, and entered AT commands via serial terminal.
